# H-Index Predictor (Improved)

An academic impact forecasting tool that predicts a researcher's H-Index 5 years ahead. Generated with BESSER's WebApp and PytorchGenerator, then improved with a polished UI on top of the generated code.

> **Base version:** The [main branch](https://github.com/DaoudiNadia/HIndexPredictor-BESSER/tree/main) contains the unmodified generated code this project builds upon.

## What is this?

This project demonstrates how BESSER's code generation can be combined with its neural network modeling capabilities. Starting from a **B-UML class diagram** and a **B-UML NN model**, BESSER generated:

- A **FastAPI backend** with full CRUD endpoints, SQLAlchemy ORM models, and Pydantic validation schemas
- A **React + TypeScript frontend** with data tables, forms, and instance method buttons
- **PyTorch training code** from the NN model via BESSER's PytorchGenerator, then manually integrated into the API as an instance method on `Researcher`

The UI was then manually improved: color scheme, typography, button styling, and the prediction result popup.

## How it Works

1. A `Researcher` record is created with current academic metrics (H-Index, citations, papers, career age)
2. Clicking **Predict My H-Index in 5 Years** calls the `/researcher/{id}/methods/predict/` endpoint
3. The backend loads the trained PyTorch model and sklearn scaler, runs inference, and returns the predicted H-Index alongside the average for the researcher's field

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite |
| ML | PyTorch, scikit-learn |
| Database | SQLite |
| Deployment | Docker Compose |

## BESSER Features Used

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| WebApp Generator | Full-stack CRUD app from B-UML class diagram |
| PytorchGenerator | MLP regression model code from B-UML NN model |

## Domain Model

The application models `Researcher` entities linked to `ResearchField`, generated from B-UML class diagram in the [BESSER online editor](https://editor.besser-pearl.org/).

## Data

The neural network is trained on the [Lucaweihs/impact-prediction](https://github.com/lucaweihs/impact-prediction) dataset from Semantic Scholar (1975-2015).

The TSV source files are not included in this repository due to their size. Download them and place them in `backend/data/` before running `prepare_data.py`:

- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2/lucaw/authorFeatures-1975-2005-2015-2.tsv.gz
- https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2/lucaw/authorResponses-1975-2005-2015-2.tsv.gz

Features used: current h-index, total citations, total papers, career age, and mean citations per paper. Target: h-index 5 years later.

The trained model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~0.9, meaning predictions are typically within 1 h-index point.

## Getting Started

### With Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Once the containers are running, seed the database once by running:

```bash
docker compose exec backend python seed.py
```

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Without Docker

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Once the backend is running for the first time, the database is created automatically. Then run the seed script once to populate the research fields:
```bash
python seed.py
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Training the Neural Network (optional)

The trained model is included. To retrain from scratch:
```bash
cd backend/nn
python prepare_data.py       # normalise raw data → train/test CSVs + scaler
python pytorch_nn_subclassing.py    # train and save the .pth model
```
